NimbleOS is an operating system tailored for personal development and customization.

NimbleOS is an OS that allows you to adapt, modify, and develop it in any way you prefer. It's ideal for constructing your own system, reminiscent of Arch, perhaps.

NimbleOS is YOUR customizable Linux playground.

NimbleOS includes a fundamental package manager called PMN (Package Manager Nimble), which is great for users looking to incorporate an additional package manager.
